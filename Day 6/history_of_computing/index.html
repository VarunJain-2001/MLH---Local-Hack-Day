                                <p class="mobile-info">COBOL was co-developed by Grace Hopper known as the "first lady of software", she developed FLOW-MATIC the language that COBOL is based on.
                                    The pupose of COBOL was twofold, to increase portability meaning it's able to be used on different hardward with minimal modifications. & 
                                    readability meaning it uses english to make the code easier to understand.

                            <p class="mobile-info">Google started as a research project called "backrub" in 1996 most of the code for the search engine was actaully written by the 'unoffical' third founder Scott Hassan 
                                but he left google before it was founded, to start a career in robotics. The domain name google.com was registered in 1997 and the company was founded in 1998. The first server 
                                was built to be as fault tolerant as possible with quite inexpensive harware.</p>

                                and write speeds were improved along with the storage space they were capable of. The "USB" part of the name refers the plug that goes into a device, that has also been improved over 
                                time going to 2.0 to 3.0 etc. Now the latest iteration of that is USB C which now looks like is slowly becoming the standard for flash drives and general connection to devices.

                            <p>Bitcoin is considered to be the first cryptocurrency released in 2009. Bitcoin's underlying technology is called blockchain, blockchain is a shared network that "facilitates the process of

                                that is the tech that essentially bitcoin is "run on". Bitcoin is a 'decentralised' digital currency users can anonymously transfer bitcoin without and third party inteference 
                                like banks or currency, however even though this is the case blockchain is still very secure as there is no one place where data is stored, making it hard for hackers to 
                                pinpoint a place to hack (for example).
